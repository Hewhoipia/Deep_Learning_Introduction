# Deep Learning Introduction
Contain all projects and exercises I have completed during the course.

Lab 1:
- PT_Part1_Intro: use PyTorch and learn how it can be used for deep learning
- PT_Part2_Music_Generation: build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation using PyTorch

Lab 2:
- PT_Part1_MNIST:  build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset
- PT_Part2_Debiasing: build a facial detection model that learns the latent variables underlying face image datasets and uses this to adaptively re-sample the training data, thus mitigating any biases that may be present to train a debiased model

Lab 3:
- LLM_Finetuning: fine-tune a multi-billion parameter large language model (LLM)

Extra exercises
- Python
- Numpy

Personal projects:
- Pistachio_Detection: using a pre-trained VGG16 Model
