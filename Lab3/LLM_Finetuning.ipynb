Fundamentally we can think of language as a sequence of \"chunks\" of text. We can split the text into individual chunks, and then map these chunks to numerical tokens -- collectively this is the process of [tokenization](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/tokenizer_summary). Numerical tokens can then be fed into a language model.\n","\n","There are several common approaches to tokenizing natural language text:\n","\n","1. **Word-based tokenization**: splits text into individual words. While simple, this can lead to large vocabularies and does not handle unknown words well.\n","\n","2. **Character-based tokenization**: splits text into individual characters. While this involves a very small vocabulary, it produces long sequences and loses word-level meaning.\n","\n","3. **Subword tokenization**: breaks words into smaller units (subwords) based on their frequency. The most popular and commonly used approach is [byte-pair encoding (BPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding), which iteratively merges the most frequent character pairs. Modern language models typically use subword tokenization as it balances vocabulary size and sequence length while handling unknown words effectively by breaking them into known subword units.\n","\n","In this lab we will use the tokenizer from the Gemma 2B model, which uses BPE.
